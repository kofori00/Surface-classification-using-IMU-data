# Surface-classification-using-IMU-data
Robots are smart… by design. To fully understand and properly navigate a task, however, they need input about their environment.  In this competition, you’ll help robots recognize the floor surface they’re standing on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors).

This notebook demonstrates the usage of euler angles, quaternions and filtering to generate features on IMU sensordata. A classification is done using a voting classifier with a Random Forest, SVM and Adaboost. 

This method generated a validation score which was rated in the top 30% of the Kaggle careercon compition.
